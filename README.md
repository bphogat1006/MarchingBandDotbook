# MarchingBandDotbook
An Android application which provides a virtual dotbook and drill for marching band
# Marching Band Dotbook

Every member in a marching band has to carry around paper copies of their music and drill. This app digitizes the music and drill to make it more accessible on the field during practice. Additional functionality includes audio playback of the show music, as well as a section to add notes for each set of the show.

## Project Info & Instructions

*This is a preview version of the project. The foundation is in place, and functionality for user interaction with the app will be further developed in the future. Currently, there are placeholder sample images for the drill pages and sheet music, and placeholder audio files for the music playback feature.*
This is an app made for devices running Android 7.0 or higher. It is not optimized for use on tablets. For installation, download the [apk](MarchingBandDotbook.apk) on your Android device. Open the file and install it.

## Plans for this project
Currently, there is a lack of some functionality in terms of user interaction with the app. Plans for future versions of this project include
* Add an edit button to write custom notes for each set
* Allow the user to upload their own pictures for the drill pages & sheet music
* Allow the user to upload audio files for the music playback feature
* Add a playback speed option for the music playback feature
